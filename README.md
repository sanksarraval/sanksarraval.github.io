## Purpose

This README is meant to explain you how to host your resume online as a static website.
After finishing this tutorial, you should be able to:

- Use Markdown and it's editor to create and edit your resume.
- Use jekyll to generate and edit a static website on your local computer.
- Use GitHub and Github Pages to host your resume online.

As you read through the instructions, you will see how practical steps align with the general principles of current technical writing, as explained in Andrew Etter's book **[Mordern Technical Writing](https://www.amazon.ca/Modern-Technical-Writing-Introduction-Documentation-ebook/dp/B01A2QL9SS)** 

## Prerequisites
Hosting a resume on GitHub Pages requires the following:
- Install [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) (a static site generator) on your local computer.
- A Markdown editor, this README was written using [readme.so](https://readme.so/editor)
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

You can read the [jekyll installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#guides) for more information depending on your operating system.

## Instructions
#### 1) Make sure you have the prerequisites.

#### 2) Create your resume in Markdown.

Open your Markdown editor and start typing your resume.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that adds and formats simple text documents. 
- It is portable, .md/.markdown files can be opened using any application.
- It is platform independent, you can use any operating system on any device to create markdown.
- It is future proof. 

The entire point of lightweight markup is to have human-readable code that everyone can write. This characteristic is pointed out by Andrew Etter in his book. 

He also adds that using Markdown also makes it easier for the users to contribute to the project.
For example, if you have a project which is modified by people with different skillsets(technical/non-technical). A lightweight, human-readable markup language makes it easier to make a purposeful contribution.

#### 3) Create a static website with Jekyll
