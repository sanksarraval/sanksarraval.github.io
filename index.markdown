<!--
- Conway's Game of Life:(C / _Course Assignment_)

	- Independently created a zero-player game for the course assignment, in which the current state of the board completely determines each step.
	- It is played on an infinite 2D grid of square cells. At any time, each cell is either populated or unpopulated.
	- The project is based on the idea that a population requires a certain size to thrive, and can expand if they are large enough, but cannot become so dense that they overtax its local resources.
