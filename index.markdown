- Calendar App (In progress):(Dart, Flutter and SQL lite / _Personal_)

	- Independently created a zero-player game for the course assignment, in which the current state of the board completely determines each step.

  

	- It is played on an infinite 2D grid of square cells. At any time, each cell is either populated or unpopulated.

  

	- The project is based on the idea that a population requires a certain size to thrive, and can expand if they are large enough, but cannot become so dense that they overtax its local resources.

  

	- Learned a lot about pointer manipulation in C and life in general.
